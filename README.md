# OU-Do (Working Title) 🚀
**The Hyper-Local Task Marketplace for the University of Oklahoma Community.**

## 📌 Project Overview
SoonerGigs is a two-sided marketplace designed specifically for the OU ecosystem. It connects "Time-Poor" individuals (busy students, faculty, and grad students) with "Cash-Poor" students who have gaps in their schedules and need flexible, short-term work.

### The Problem
* **Rigid Employment:** Traditional campus jobs require fixed 15-20 hour weekly commitments.
* **Safety Concerns:** Existing platforms (Craigslist/FB Marketplace) are full of non-OU "townies" and scammers.
* **Friction:** Tasks like waiting in line at the Union, moving dorm furniture, or game-day errands have no dedicated platform.

### The Solution
A trust-based, **@ou.edu verified** mobile application that allows students to monetize their "micro-gaps" in time while providing affordable, reliable help to the campus community.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Planned)
* **Frontend:** [e.g., Flutter / React Native / Glide No-Code]
* **Backend:** [e.g., Firebase / Supabase]
* **Verification:** Python-based email validation script for `@ou.edu` domains.
* **Payments:** Stripe Connect API for secure peer-to-peer transactions.
* **Maps:** Google Maps API for campus-specific task pinning.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `/docs`: Market research, pitch decks, and wireframe exports.
* `/backend`: Logic for user verification and payment processing.
* `/ui-ux`: Branding assets, logos (Canva/Figma), and CSS styles.
* `/scripts`: Automation for task expiration and notification triggers.

## ⚖️ Safety & Compliance
* **Verified Access:** All users must authenticate via OU email.

* **Liability:** Terms of Service drafted to define the app as a marketplace, not an employer (consulting with OU Entrepreneurial Law Center).
